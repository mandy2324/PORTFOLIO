# PORTFOLIO:

### This is my portfolio and it represents the skills I learned during my journey through boot camp. This journey  not only polished my skills as a developer, it also taught me to think differently.

### This project includes the Html, css and bootstrap.

 ### I have a deployed link of all my projects as you click on the cards under work section.
